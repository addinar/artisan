## Project Pitch
Artisan is a web platform for independent artists to sell their art courses and provide structured feedback to enrolled students. Aspiring artists can enroll courses of their interest, access gated video lessons or art timelapses, and submit their work to course hosts for critiques and feedback. Artisan will additionally offer all users a chance to showcase their portfolio in order to establish their credibility and incentivize other users to enroll in their course. This platform will consist of asynchronous learning workflows, and will use software engineering in order to foster creativity and grow art skills. 

## Project Description
The domain of art is expansive and requires a flexible, adaptive, and dynamic set of skills that can be difficult for a new artist to learn all at once. Historically, artists would seek apprenticeship from art masters to build their artistry. Today, however, aspiring artists have to reply on fragmented resources scattered across the Internet. In addition, they have little to no source of expert guidance to improve their own art. A single, centralized hub where an aspiring artist can access an entire library of art courses and receive direct feedback from their favorite artists can address this gap. This is what Artisan aims to do. Artisan will be a centralized hub which would provide both artists in training a chance to perfect their skills, and already skilled artists to establish themselves as a Renaissance master would. 

Artisan has two primary user roles: artists who can host an unlimited number of courses, and students. Artists set a one-time price for their course and upload gated video lessons, while students can enroll for said course by purchasing it. Allowing artists themselves to create learnable content will not only provide them with an additional source of income, but also diversify the course catalog, allowing students to filter and browse through various courses for different art mediums and stylistic variations of color, light, and anatomy. Students can also pay a one-time fee to any artist of their choosing to submit their own artwork and receive structured, detailed feedback from the artist themself, without needing to pay the full price of their course(s). The feedback can be in text, image, and/or video form. They can rate and review courses by its content and artists by their feedback in order to establish artists' legitimacy. Additionally, any user (whether they are a student or artist) can showcase their portfolios and link their social medias. These features can harmonize into a centralized system with asynchronous learning, structured critique, access control, and content organization to encourage the spread of art skills.
